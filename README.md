# Jenkins
The leading open source automation server, Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project. Check out the sweet video [here](media/JenkinsBuild.mp4). 

# Pre-Requisites
* Jenkins Instance with the http_request plugin installed.
* Jenkins Communication Plan (see files) imported into xMatters or created in xMatters.
* xMatters account - If you don't have one, [get one](https://www.xmatters.com)!

# Files
* [JenkinsLibrary.js](Jenkins.js) - The javascript file to be pasted into a Shared Library. Jenkins is limited to pushing 3 or 4 environmental variables via the http_request plugin.  This library reaches back into Jenkins via a GET command to extract additional information about the build. 
* [Jenkins.zip](Jenkins(1).zip) - The Communication Plan (optional).  You can use this pre built communication plan and import it into your xMatters instance or create one from scratch. 
* [JenkinsIB.js](JenkinsIB.js) - The javascript file to be pasted into the Inbound IB component.  This script calls the library.

# Installation

## Jenkins set up
Install the Jenkins http_request plugin [Jenkins Http_Request Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/HTTP+Request+Plugin).  In Jenkins select a build and click on the Configure option.  In the configure option add a build step and select the Http_Request item.

| Request Body | JSON formated body of Jenkins Environmental values available to the http_plugin. [Jenkins Set Environment Variables](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Building+a+software+project) |


## xMatters set up
1. Import the Communication Plan (see files).  If this step is done you can skip steps 2 and 3.
2. Create a new Shared Library and add the code from the JenkinsLibrary.js file.  
3. Create (In|Out)bound integration and add the code from the JenkinsIB.js file.
4. Configure the xMatters Endpoints. [xMatters Endpoints](https://help.xmatters.com/OnDemand/xmodwelcome/integrationbuilder/configure-endpoints.htm)
5. Create a DevOps group in xMatters and add your self to the group. [xMatters Groups](https://help.xmatters.com/OnDemand/groups/groups.htm).  The name of the DevOps group can be changed in the Inbound IB script.
